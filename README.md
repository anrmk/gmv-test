# GMV test

By Aziz Nurmukhamedov

A simple page that randomly generates columns of integer data type and has a total and average row at the bottom

## Technologies used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- JQuery

## Description
This browser application allows the user to edit each cell in the table and get the sum and average result at the bottom.
### Requirements

1. The example in the GitHub link randomly generates 10 columns of integer data type and
has a total row at the bottom. Add another row for calculating the averages. Ensure that
the average is updated on each cell edit.
2. Now, let the 3rd column be a simple text field that can take up to 80 characters, (cannot
include any special characters). Assume random data generation at load time.
3. Now, let the 4th column be a date-type column. Assume random data generation at load
time. Use a read-only formatter that will display the number of weeks and number of days.
For example: if the data entered in the US locale is 01/20/2021, then the formatter would
display the info on the cell as Week 3, Day 20 of 2021. For this column, we donâ€™t want to
see totals, but we do want to record the average.
